        <h2>
            Neuroplasticity 
        </h2>
        <p>
            Neuroplasticity refers to the malleable and adaptable nature of the brain, and how they can change depending on our interaction with different environments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The neuron pathways in our brain are not static like computer processors, but can build upon existing pathways. This happens when we engage with a thought or an action multiple times. This is why when we practice a certain action such as playing an instrument, we can see ourselves becoming more effective and efficient. Vice-versa, not engaging with said thoughts and actions can result in the brain “pruning out” the established neural-connections, resulting in efficiency when performing those tasks.
        </p>
        <p>
            From different research and studies, we have learned that neuroplasticity has varying benefits to our cognitive functions, including enhanced memories and more effective learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            So how might we improve upon our neuroplasticity? According to <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/neuroplasticity/"  target="_blank">PositivePsychology.com</a>, there are the following ways to improve upon them:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Intermittent fasting </li>
            <li> Traveling </li>
            <li> Using mnemonic devices (memory training technic </li>
            <li> Musical Instruments </li>
            <li> Non-dominant hand exercise </li>
            <li> Reading fiction </li>
            <li> Expanding vocabulary </li>
            <li> Creating artwork </li>
            <li> Dancing </li>
            <li> Sleeping </li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>
            Growth Mindset
        </h2>
        <p>
            Growth mindset is a belief that an individual's intelligence is not static, but has an innate potential to improve over time and effort. In contrast, a fixed mindset is a belief that people’s intelligence is set in stone from birth, and cannot become smarter. From what we have discussed about neuroplasticity, we understand that the former belief is the correct mindset
        </p>

        <p>
            Dr. Carol Dweck’s research into young student’s learning patterns has shown that the difference between adopting and not adopting the growth mindset has resulted in different behaviour students and therefore, different results to their grades. Those who were taught intelligence can grow from engagement and effort were more likely to be engaged, take on challenges, learn from mistakes and ultimately see improvement in their grades. In contrast, those students who were not taught about neuroplasticity were more likely to avoid challenges, dismiss the errors and ultimately scored worse than their counterparts.

        <p>
            I believe the growth mindset is something we all can adopt and make use of in our daily lives. When we get stuck in difficult challenges, it reminds us that just because we are stuck now, doesn’t mean that we will be permanently. It helps us to stay positive and tenacious in our endeavour break through barriers and continue learning.
