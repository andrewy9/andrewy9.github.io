    <h2>
        What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
            I am always wanting to prove myself that I can do certain things and that I am competent.
        </li>
        <li>
            I hate feeling stuck or stupid and maybe that is why sometimes I might be too stubborn to ask for help.
        </li>
        <li>
            However, I also adopted a growth mindset and find learning more valuable (and more enjoyable) than stroking
            my ego.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?
    </h2>

    <p>
        They are all very important aspects for living a good life, not just in work or programming.

        Having good self awareness will help you understand what paths and actions you should take and why..

        Understanding your value can guide your action and give meaning to them, and your empathy can help you connect
        with others and learn more about what this world has to offer.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What has surprised you the most about the core learning?
    </h2>

    <p>
        I am happy to have learned more about meditation and mindfulness, and was quite surprised how much they helped
        with the technical learnings from this course. Of course, I can often get carried away and not take a break when
        needed but when I do, mindfulness training helps quite a bit.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Writing personal aspects for myself isn’t too difficult for me. However, writing them for others to see was
        quite difficult for me as I wasn’t sure how much I wanted to share. I also didn’t know how I could explain my
        thoughts in a way that was concise and understandable. In the end, I decided to keep them short and to the
        minimum.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Why do I think a programming school is spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development
        bootcamp course?
    </h2>
    <p>
        There is a saying: “train for skill, hire for attitude”. In this case, your attitude in large part can be a
        reflection of your personality, value and your desire. Through core learning, you can gain further understanding
        of yourself and develop your attitude in a manner that more benefits yourself and your growth.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that
        time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.
    </h2>
    <p>
        The time I spend learning from the core exercises has allowed me the time to re-evaluate myself and really think
        about what I want. While a lot of the materials such as Emotional Intelligence and Neuroplasticty was something
        I already knew about, I believe the revision of the subject was beneficial for me and it reminded me that I
        don’t need to stress about performing but more on growing.
