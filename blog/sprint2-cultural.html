        <h2>
            My long-term goal/career pathway.
        </h2>
        <p>
            With the world economy being precarious as it is, and the future being even more so unclear, I am not exactly sure what would be the best long term goal or career path that I should have.
        </p>
        <p>
            For me, what is important to me is to be consistent and always be learning. So my mid to longer term plan will be to upload something on Git-hub, 5 times a week, every week for the next 3 years. My secondary goal is to learn Python and GoLang. Maybe after 3 years and building more knowledge, skills and ability to be consistent, I will have a clearer view of the path I should take.
        </p>
        <h2>Non-technical skills I would like to see developed in EDA</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to continue to improve my communication and collaboration skills. With the whole course being online, it would be highly beneficial to learn more digital communication skills. This skill will be coming more in demand in the upcoming post-covid (or mid-covid) era.
        </p>
        <h2>Strength and limitation
        </h2>
        <p>
            My core competence is that I have an open mind, and the solid attitude to embrace learning. I have the patience to deal with complicated issues and collaborate in a team.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            My limitation would be that there isn’t a time where I can look back where I have been doing something consistently, regularly, for more than a year (not counting education and work of course). This is the reason why I set my “long-term” goal as it is.
        </p>
        
        <h2>
            EDA course workload plan
        </h2>

        <p>
            For the foundation, I will be working between 7 to 8 hours a day, and some odd extra study hours during the weekend. I will be utilising the Pomodoro technique to regulate my breaks.
        </p>

        <p>
            During the boot-camp, I will be aiming to work 70hour a week or more. It will depend upon what the project is and what the time flexibility of my group will be like, but I will be aiming to work either 10 hours a day, everyday, or 12 hours for 5 days and 10 hours for one weekend.
        </p>
        <h2>How I will seek help in a timely way
        </h2>
        <p>
            I will be asking questions to the facilitators or the slack group whenever I have a question that I cannot solve after trying. I will use my own search ability first before seeking help. If there is not any need to ask for help, I can also ask for constructive feedback on my work.
        </p>
        <h2>My expectation for the facilitators
        </h2>
        I would appreciate help on certain problems through a screen share every now and then. Also, I often like to ask a lot of what if when learning things. It can be annoying but it would definitely be helpful for me if they could help with many of my follow up questions, not just the actual problems at hand.
