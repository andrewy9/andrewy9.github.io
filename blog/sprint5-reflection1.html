    <h2>
        What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
    </h2>

    <p>
        I want to be able to do something creative and meaningful. Of course to be able to do that, I will need to
        continue building my skills and discipline, so I will be trying to look for a job where I can learn the most.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the longer term, I want to take part in bigger and meaningful projects that can help other people in
        different ways, whether it be applications that help local businesses or create something for a charity
        organisation, etc.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?
    </h2>
    <p>
        My biggest strength will be the willingness to learn, not just technically but also as a person. I believe that
        from this journey that I have learned a lot about myself, including my growth potential and also my what may be
        holding me back.
    </p>
    <p>
        The weakness that may be holding me back is the doubt and fear if things are going to work out. Over thinking
        can make me hesitant and sometimes I can run away from it and let myself get distracted with other things that
        can help me forget. However if I can remember to not overthink and enjoy learning for the sake of it, I see
        myself doing better (and happier!).
    </p>

    <h2>
        What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?
    </h2>
    <p>
        My biggest challenge may be asking for help. I have a habit of wanting to solve a question by myself, not just
        because I want to make sure that I want to confirm I actually understand it, but so that I can do that by myself
        in the future (e.g. in a job).
    </p>

    <p>
        When I was doing an online course, at certain times I felt like I was just copy and pasting and not really
        learning it, and I didn’t feel like I was learning from watching what others.
    </p>

    <p>
        I feel that during the boot camp, I will have to remind myself that this time, it won’t be just asking help to
        get answers to copy paste but interacting with others to both learn and teach at the same time.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?
    </h2>

    <p>
        In the beginning of this course, I said my goal was to learn to be more consistent. This still holds true. This
        can apply to both committing to work, committing to taking a break, and committing to the team.
    </p>

    <h2>
        What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp
    </h2>

    <p>
        I will need to remind myself the facilitators will be trying to help me by making me understand the problems and
        solutions myself, not just give answers. I also sometimes understand things better by teaching, so I will try to
        actively share what I learned or code that created, explain them, and ask for feedback. I will also try to
        answer my team member’s questions proactively.
    </p>

    <p>
        I will be committing 11 hours a day from Monday to Saturday, and maybe commit 2 hours on Sunday to recap my
        learning or catch-up in areas where I wasn’t able to cover. Maybe I can spend those 2 hours asking or answering
        questions.
